# [Project 1: Testing the law of large numbers using a random number generator](https://github.com/kt2795/Kartik_Portfolio/blob/951576e68fd6fab74c43d551e271caab78f183c5/Law%20Of%20Large%20Numbers.ipynb)
* Imported the numpy package to use randn function
* Defined N, idea being larger the N, more accurate the results
* Ran it through a for loop N times using a counter
* The counter updated everytime the number fell between -1 and 1
* Expected results is that the proportion of random numbers under -1 and 1 is around 68%
