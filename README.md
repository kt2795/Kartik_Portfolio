# Kartik_Portfolio
Practice projects worked on independently, including assignments from undergone trainings, kaggle and google datasets.
# [Project 1 - Testing the law of large numbers using a random number generator](https://github.com/kt2795/Kartik_Portfolio/blob/951576e68fd6fab74c43d551e271caab78f183c5/Law%20Of%20Large%20Numbers.ipynb)
* Imported the numpy package to use randn function
* Ran it through a for loop using a counter N times.
* The counter would update everytime the number generated fell between -1 and 1
* Expected results is that the proportion of random numbers generated fall under -1 and 1 is around 68%
