## [Project 1: Testing the law of large numbers using a random number generator](https://github.com/kt2795/Kartik_Portfolio/blob/951576e68fd6fab74c43d551e271caab78f183c5/Law%20Of%20Large%20Numbers.ipynb)
* Aim - To practice the learnings on conditional statements, loops and basic arithmetic operations
  * Import the numpy package to use randn function
  * Define N, idea being larger the N, more accurate the results
  * Run it through a for loop N times using a counter
  * The counter updates everytime the number falls between -1 and 1
* Expected results is that the proportion of random numbers under -1 and 1 is around 68%

## [Project 2: Basic financial analysis using lists](https://github.com/kt2795/Kartik_Portfolio/blob/7658dd32a8d4e714aac58fe86383239954fbb679/Project%202:%20Financial%20Analysis%20using%20lists.ipynb)
* Aim - Advancing further, this project aims to consolidate learnings on lists by conducting a brief financial analysis
  * The project starts with the data on expenses and revenues for all 12 months, in the list data type
  * Project contains calculations around profit, tax, profit after tax, profit margin, mean profit after tax, good or bad months based on whether they are more or less than the mean profit after tax, and finding the best and the worst month  

## [Project 3: Basketball Analysis](https://github.com/kt2795/Kartik_Portfolio/blob/7756148ddf567bdb142c06a073345ed868e67cc1/Project%203%20Basketball%20Analysis.ipynb)
* Aim - With the help of a sample pre-prepared dataset available in lists, the project aims to practice the learnings around matrices visualisation
  * The prepared dataset contains information on player's salaries, games, minutes played, field goals, field goals attempts, points, etc.
  * The information is presented in the form of lists. Therefore through the numpy package the lists are converted into matrices using np.array
  * The beginning of the project explores the use of arrays and matrices in python, moving on to dictionaries
  * The use of dictionaries helps in navigating through the matrix of player's data across the name and year
  * Using pyplot module within the matplotlib package, we chart the data playing with color, marker type, marker size,x ticks and labels
  * We develop our own function using custom dictionaries and for loops for ease of charting of a large dataset with custom requirements
    * Default charting when the function is passed without parameters is defined
  * Testing of the function is carried out
