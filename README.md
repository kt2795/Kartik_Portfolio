#Project 1 - Testing the law of large numbers using a random number generator
* Imported the numpy package to use randn function
* Ran it through a for loop using a counter N times.
* The counter would update everytime the number generated fell between -1 and 1
* Expected results is that the proportion of random numbers generated fall under -1 and 1 is around 68%
